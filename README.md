# Pass Puss - password manager for those who respect privacy



A cross-platform(planned) application to store and share safely sign-in information for accounts of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc.

Pass Puss is not a simple password manager. It's a complex management system made for those who crave to keep their passwords safe and back it up in the safe place.

## Our goal is to

1. Keep your passwords safe on your device encrypted by <b>AES-256</b>.
2. Help you with <b>generating passwords</b> easily with whatever pattern you like.
3. Back up data on your <i><b>Google Drive</b></i> or other storage systems.
4. Encrypt the data by the biometrics systems like the fingerprint scanning or facial recognition. 
5. Keep you independent from all ecosystems.
